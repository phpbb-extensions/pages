## Customising Pages

[View the Wiki](https://github.com/phpbb-extensions/pages/wiki/Customising-Pages) for guides to customise page link icons and page templates.

## Converting from a MOD

Pages can convert/import data from [Static Pages MOD 1.0.3](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/static_pages). If Pages finds the Static Pages MOD data in your database, it will automagically convert it when you enable Pages. To complete the transition, we recommend you review the Static Pages MOD's install instructions in order to remove the file-edits to `constants.php` and delete all of the included files the MOD added to your forum.

Note: Pages will keep a backup of the Static Pages MOD data in a database table named `pages_mod_backup`. Pages will never delete or alter this backup table. Pages has not been tested with any other similar MODs.
